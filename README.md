# Overview

`meaview` is a graphical application, written in C++ using the [Qt application
development framework](https://www.qt.io). It connects to the 
[Baccus Lab Data Server](https://github.com/baccuslab/blds.git), and plots
in realtime the data from either a live or old recording. It contains widgets
for connecting to the server, controlling the data playback, and setting options
for how the data is viewed. The program cannot *control* a recording, so it
must be used in concert with either [`meactl'](https://github.com/baccuslab/meactl.git)
or the Python [`bldsclient`](https://github.com/libblds-client.git) module.

Details of how to use the application as an experimenter are given in
the User Guide. If you wish to understand the design and implementation of
`meaview`, you can refer to the documenation generated by Doxygen. The source
code itself is also well-documented, and should be referred to as the final
reference for the implementation.
